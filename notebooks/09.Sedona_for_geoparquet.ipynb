    "# GeoParquet, parquet for geospatial data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn what are the parquet and geoparquet file format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is apache parquet?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Apache Parquet** is a `columnar storage file format` widely used in big data analytics (Spark, Hive, Dask, DuckDB). Unlike row-based file format, parquet stored values from the same column sequentially. This makes column scans fast and compresses better.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, row based storage will save data like:\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "id, name, age\n",
    "1, Alice, 34\n",
    "2, Bob, 45\n",
    "3, Carol, 29\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And, column based storage will save data like:\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "id: [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "name: [Alice, Bob, Carol]\n",
    "age: [34, 45, 29]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare to row based format, `columnar storage file format (parquet)` has the below advantages are:\n",
    "- Column encoding is possible: the encoding such as `dictionary`, `run-length encoding (RLE)`, `bit-packing` can improve storage and lecture speed.\n",
    "- Better compression: values are similar in the same column, so it compresses much better than row formats.\n",
    "- Better data loading performance: `projection pushdown`(reads only required column), `predicate pushdown`(reads only relevant chunks if filter conditions match).\n",
    "- The Schema and metadata are embedded and customizable.\n",
    "- Data partition is supported: works well in distributed systems, and efficient for large-scale analytical queries (data warehouses, data lakes).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantages are:\n",
    "- Not Ideal for datasets(<1MB): metadata and encoding may cost you more than the actual data\n",
    "- Not human-readable: Parquet is a binary format. You need tools (e.g. Pandas, DuckDB, etc.) to read and debug.\n",
    "Complexity\n",
    "- Write Cost: Writing is more CPU-intensive (encoding + compression). Insert or update a row may require to rewrite the whole parquet file.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Parquet is a file format designed for large-scale data analytics with the pattern Write Once Read Many(worm). It's not ideal for small, transactional workloads(e.g. need update data every second).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is GeoParquet?\n",
    "\n",
    "**GeoParquet** is an extension of `Apache Parquet` designed for storing `geospatial vector data` (points, lines, polygons) in a columnar, compressed, efficient format.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to store `geospatial vector data`, **GeoParquet** adds the below concepts in the metadata of the parquet:\n",
    "- which column is geometry column\n",
    "- how geometries data is encoded(e.g. WKB, GeoArrow, etc.).\n",
    "- which CRS(Coordinate Reference System) is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a typical geoparquet metadata looks like\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"version\": \"1.0.0-beta.1\",\n",
    "  \"primary_column\": \"geometry\",\n",
    "  \"columns\": {\n",
    "    \"geometry\": {\n",
    "      \"encoding\": \"WKB\",\n",
    "      \"geometry_types\": [\"Polygon\", \"MultiPolygon\"],\n",
    "      \"crs\": \"EPSG:4326\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> The parquet file has one geometry column called `geometry`, it use `WKB` as geospatial data encoding. The crs is\n",
    "> `EPSG:4326`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of geoparquet:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Much faster than GeoJSON or Shapefile for analytics.\n",
    "- Can be partitioned for big data volume. It works well with distributed engines (Spark, Dask).\n",
    "- Reduce disk usage due to columnar storage & compression.\n",
    "- Standardized metadata ensures interoperability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supported tools\n",
    "\n",
    "The below tools can read geoparquet\n",
    "\n",
    "- GeoPandas (Python)\n",
    "- Sedona(Python, Java, scala)\n",
    "- DuckDB(Python, R, SQL)\n",
    "- Fiona/GDAL\n",
